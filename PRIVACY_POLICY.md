# Privacy Policy for Win 10 Minutes App

  **Last Updated: October 15, 2024**

  ## Overview
  Win 10 Minutes ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.

  ## Information We Collect
  ### Information Stored Locally
  All data created and used by Win 10 Minutes is stored locally on your device:
  - Focus session history and statistics
  - Building and city progress
  - Empire conquest progress
  - Settings and preferences
  - Task names and completion status
  - User handle (e.g., @BuildWithLuiz)

  ### AI Task Breakdown (Premium Feature)
  When you use the AI Task Breakdown feature:
  - **What is sent**: The task/goal text you enter
  - **Where it goes**: OpenAI's API to generate actionable subtasks
  - **What is NOT sent**: No personal information, user identifiers, or device data
  - **Storage**: We do not store your task descriptions on our servers
  - **Your control**: This feature is optional and only activated when you explicitly tap "AI TASK BREAKDOWN"

  ### Information We Do NOT Collect
  We do not collect, transmit, or store personal information on external servers. This includes:
  - No personal identification information
  - No location data
  - No contact information
  - No analytics or tracking data beyond local app usage
  - No advertising identifiers

  ## Data Storage
  All app data is stored using iOS's local storage (UserDefaults and local files). This data:
  - Remains on your device
  - Is included in your iCloud backup if you have iCloud Backup enabled
  - Can be deleted by uninstalling the app

  ## Notifications
  The app uses local notifications to remind you about:
  - Focus session status
  - Break reminders
  - Session completion

  These notifications are scheduled locally and do not involve any external servers.

  ## Third-Party Services

  ### OpenAI API (Premium Feature Only)
  We use OpenAI's API exclusively for the AI Task Breakdown feature:

  **What data is sent:**
  - Only the task/goal text you enter when using AI Task Breakdown
  - No personal information or user identifiers

  **How it's used:**
  - Solely to generate task breakdowns for you
  - OpenAI processes the request according to their API Data Usage Policy
  - OpenAI does not use API data to train their models (per their API policy)

  **Third-party privacy policy:**
  - OpenAI: https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies

  **Your control:**
  - This feature is optional (Premium users only)
  - Data is only sent when you explicitly tap "AI TASK BREAKDOWN"
  - You can choose to enter tasks manually instead

  ### Screen Time API
  The app uses Apple's Screen Time API to block distracting apps during focus sessions. This is a local iOS feature and does not transmit data externally.

  ### In-App Purchases
  Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple through their secure payment system. We never have access to your payment card information.

  ## Children's Privacy
  The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is suitable for all ages.

  ## Data Security
  Since most data is stored locally on your device, security is managed by iOS's built-in security features. For data sent to OpenAI (AI feature only):
  - Transmitted securely via HTTPS
  - Not stored on our servers
  - Processed according to OpenAI's API data policy

  We recommend:
  - Using a device passcode
  - Keeping your iOS updated
  - Using iCloud Backup for data recovery

  ## Your Rights
  You have complete control over your data:
  - Delete all app data by uninstalling the app
  - Reset data within the app through Settings
  - Disable notifications in iOS Settings
  - Choose not to use AI Task Breakdown feature
  - Request information about data sent to OpenAI by contacting us

  ## California Privacy Rights
  If you are a California resident, you have the right to:
  - Know what personal information is collected
  - Request deletion of your personal information
  - Opt-out of sale of personal information (we do not sell data)

  ## European Union Users
  If you are in the EU, you have rights under GDPR:
  - Right to access your data
  - Right to rectification
  - Right to erasure
  - Right to data portability

  Since data is stored locally on your device, you have full control through app settings and device management.

  ## Changes to This Policy
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted with app updates, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised.
